# A Formal Treatment of Bidirectional Typing

## Introduction

This is the repository for the development, including formal proofs and tex code, presented in the paper *A formal treatment of bidirectional typing*.

### Abstract from the paper

> There has been much progress in designing bidirectional type systems and associated type synthesis algorithms, but mainly on a case- by-case basis. To remedy the situation, this paper develops a general and formal theory of bidirectional typing and as a by-product of our formalism provides a verified generator of proof-relevant type synthesisers for simply typed languages: for every signature that specifies a mode- correct bidirectionally typed language, there exists a proof-relevant type synthesiser that for an input abstract syntax tree constructs a typing derivation if any, gives its refutation if not, or reports that the input does not have enough type annotations. Soundness, completeness, and mode- correctness are studied universally for all signatures, which are sufficient conditions for deriving a type synthesiser. We propose a preprocessing step called mode decoration, which helps the user to deal with missing type annotations in a given abstract syntax tree. The entire development is formalised in Agda and can be further integrated with other language- formalisation frameworks.

## Repository organisation

This repository consists of the following directories and files.

- [`README.agda`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/master/README.agda) is a walkthrough of the formal implementation with mappings to the paper.
- [`src/`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/master/src/) is the formal implementation in Agda.
  - [`src/Example/STLC.agda`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/master/src/Example/STLC.agda) contains the example of simply typed lambda calculus presented in the Appendix *Demonstration* of the paper.
- [`tex/`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/master/tex/) is the tex code for the paper including
  all submissions, reviews, and our reponses.
  - In particular, [`tex/ESOP24/`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/master/tex/ESOP24) contains the accepted ESOP'24 submission.
- [`docs/`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/master/doc/) is the listing of source code published [here](https://l-tchen.github.io/BiSig/README.html)
- `agda-stdlib/` is the Agda standard library `v2.0` as a Git submodule. 

## Requirements

To type-check the formal implementation, you need

- `Agda` version `2.6.4.1`

### Agda

An earlier version such as `2.6.4` compatible with the standard library `v2.0` may work. 
Should you have no `Agda` installed or fail to check `README.agda` with an earlier version of Agda, you may

- Install [`Agda 2.6.4.1`](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.4.1/getting-started/installation.html)
or
- Use the Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ltchentw/agda/) for `Agda 2.6.4.1`, i.e. containerised Agda.

## Instructions

To browse and check this repository locally, please follow the instructions below.

0. Open a terminal emulator.

   For example, you may use the application `Terminal` on macOS or `Windows Terminal` on Windows 10 (or later).

1. Clone this repository (in the terminal)

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig.git
   ```

   This repository contains the Agda standard library as a Git submodule, so it is necessary to clone this repository with the submodule.

2. Change the working directory to the local repository

   ```bash
   cd [the location of your copy of this repo]
   ```

3. (Optional) If you have no `Agda`, you may install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and use [containerised `Agda`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ltchentw/agda) as follow:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --mount type=bind,source"=${PWD}",destination=/BiSig -w /BiSig ltchentw/agda:2.6.4.1
   ```

   This command pulls the pre-built image, which contains `Agda 2.6.4.1`, from Docker Hub and runs the image as a container with the current working directory mounted at `/BiSig/` internally. 

4. Type-check the walkthrough file
   
   ```bash
   agda README.agda
   ```

   The option `--safe` has been specified additionally in the [`BiSig.agda-lib`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/65b02a2d29148aeb88c701714c3d1d231a9d6a8f/BiSig.agda-lib#L8) and [`README.agda`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/65b02a2d29148aeb88c701714c3d1d231a9d6a8f/README.agda#L9) to ensure that *no* definitions are postulated.

5. Finally, use an editor that supports the Agda development, such as Emacs with the [Agda mode](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/emacs-mode.html) or VS Code with the [extension for Agda](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=banacorn.agda-mode), to play with this repo.

   If you use the docker image for Agda, then Emacs with Agda mode is already available to use inside the container.

   Hint. Start with `README.agda` or try to normalise the term [`‚ä¢S?`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/93767edf3e788cf7cf6d749f777f99e0a2ffafdc/src/Example/STLC.agda#L118-L119) in [`src/Example/STLC.agda`](https://github.com/L-TChen/BiSig/blob/master/src/Example/STLC.agda).
