                   and type inference. The conventional presentation of
                   bi-directional type checking consists of two modes:
                   inference mode and checked mode. In traditional
                   bi-directional type-checking, type annotations are
                   used to guide (via the checked mode) the type
                   inference/checking procedure to determine the type of
                   an expression, and type information flows from
                   functions to arguments.},

                   design organization. The resulting typing discipline

                   that does not apply just to one language but, rather,
                   applies to many languages of a certain class. In this
                   paper, we present Lang-n-Prove, a domain-specific
                   language for expressing theorems and proofs in such a
                   way that they apply to many languages. The main
                   characteristic of Lang-n-Prove is that it contains
                   linguistic features that are specific to the domain
                   of language design. We have used Lang-n-Prove to
                   express the theorems and proofs of canonical forms
                   lemmas, the progress theorem, and the type
                   preservation theorem for a restricted class of
                   functional languages. We have applied our
                   Lang-n-Prove proofs to several functional languages,

                   recursive types, list operations, and other common
                   types and operators. Our tool has generated the proof
                   code in Abella that machine-checks the type safety of
                   all these languages, when the correct code for

                   languages required careful handling to maintain the
                   correct behaviour of bound variables. Modern
                   programming languages include features that enable
                   constraints like scope safety to be expressed in

                   over the last decade to support several large
                   formalization efforts. Terms are defined for an
                   arbitrary number of constructors of varying numbers
                   of inputs, quotiented to alpha-equivalence and sorted

                   and freshness---namely, there are lemmas showing how

                   abstract syntax},
  year =          {2022},
  abstract =      {In previous work ("From signatures to monads in
                   UniMath"),we described a category-theoretic
                   construction of abstract syntax from a signature,
                   mechanized in the UniMath library based on the Coq
                   proof assistant. In the present work, we describe
                   what was necessary to generalize that work to account
                   for simply-typed languages. First, some definitions
                   had to be generalized to account for the natural
                   appearance of non-endofunctors in the simply-typed
                   case. As it turns out, in many cases our mechanized
                   results carried over to the generalized definitions
                   without any code change. Second, an existing
                   mechanized library on 𝜔-cocontinuous functors had
                   to be extended by constructions and theorems
                   necessary for constructing multi-sorted syntax.
                   Third, the theoretical framework for the semantical
                   signatures had to be generalized from a monoidal to a
                   bicategorical setting, again to account for
                   non-endofunctors arising in the typed case. This uses
                   actions of endofunctors on functors with given
                   source, and the corresponding notion of strong
                   functors between actions, all formalized in UniMath
                   using a recently developed library of bicategory
                   theory. We explain what needed to be done to plug all
                   of these ingredients together, modularly. The main
                   result of our work is a general construction that,
                   when fed with a signature for a simply-typed
                   language, returns an implementation of that language
                   together with suitable boilerplate code, in
                   particular, a certified monadic substitution
                   operation.},

                   over a monad. The associated notion of morphism of
                   left modules (``linear'' natural transformations)
                   captures an important property of compatibility with
                   substitution, not only in the so-called homogeneous
                   case but also in the heterogeneous case where
                   ``terms'' and variables therein could be of different

  abstract =      {We develop algebraic models of simple type theories,
                   laying out a framework that extends universal algebra
                   to incorporate both algebraic sorting and variable
                   binding. Examples of simple type theories include the
                   unityped and simply-typed λ-calculi, the
                   computational λ-calculus, and predicate logic.Simple
                   type theories are given models in presheaf
                   categories, with structure specified by algebras of
                   polynomial endofunctors that correspond to natural
                   deduction rules. Initial models, which we construct,
                   abstractly describe the syntax of simple type
                   theories. Taking substitution structure into
                   consideration, we further provide sound and complete
                   semantics in structured cartesian multicategories.
                   This development generalises Lambek's correspondence
                   between the simply-typed λ-calculus and
                   cartesian-closed categories, to arbitrary simple type
                   theories.},

  abstract =      {The correct definition and implementation of
                   non-trivial type systems is difficult and requires
                   expert knowledge, which is not available to
                   developers of domain-specific languages (DSLs) in
                   practice. We propose Veritas, a workbench that
                   simplifies the development of sound type systems.
                   Veritas provides a single, high-level specification
                   language for type systems, from which it
                   automatically tries to derive soundness proofs and
                   efficient and correct type-checking algorithms. For
                   verification, Veritas combines off-the-shelf
                   automated first-order theorem provers with automated
                   proof strategies specific to type systems. For
                   deriving efficient type checkers, Veritas provides a
                   collection of optimization strategies whose
                   applicability to a given type system is checked
                   through verification on a case-by-case basis. We have
                   developed a prototypical implementation of Veritas
                   and used it to verify type soundness of the
                   simply-typed lambda calculus and of parts of typed
                   SQL. Our experience suggests that many of the
                   individual verification steps can be automated and,
                   in particular, that a high degree of automation is
                   possible for type systems of DSLs.},

  abstract =      {Static typing can guide programmers if feedback is
                   immediate. Therefore, all major IDEs incrementalize
                   type checking in some way. However, prior approaches
                   to incremental type checking are often specialized
                   and hard to transfer to new type systems. In this
                   paper, we propose a systematic approach for deriving
                   incremental type checkers from textbook-style type
                   system specifications. Our approach is based on
                   compiling inference rules to Datalog, a carefully
                   limited logic programming language for which
                   incremental solvers exist. The key contribution of
                   this paper is to discover an encoding of the infinite
                   typing relation as a finite Datalog relation in a way
                   that yields efficient incremental updates. We
                   implemented the compiler as part of a type system DSL
                   and show that it supports simple types, some local
                   type inference, operator overloading, universal
                   types, and iso-recursive types.},

                   that missing annotations are recovered using only

                   without long-distance constraints such as unification

                   type checking, which checks that a program satisfies

                   type from the program. Using checking enables
                   bidirectional typing to support features for which
                   inference is undecidable; using synthesis enables
                   bidirectional typing to avoid the large annotation
