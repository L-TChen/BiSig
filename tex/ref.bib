  abstract =      {Girard and Reynolds independently invented System F
                   (a.k.a. the second-order polymorphically typed lambda
                   calculus) to handle problems in logic and computer
                   programming language design, respectively. Viewing F
                   in the Curry style, which associates types with
                   untyped lambda terms, raises the questions of
                   typability and type checking. Typability asks for a
                   term whether there exists some type it can be given.
                   Type checking asks, for a particular term and type,
                   whether the term can be given that type. The
                   decidability of these problems has been settled for
                   restrictions and extensions of F and related systems
                   and complexity lower-bounds have been determined for
                   typability in F, but this report is the first to
                   resolve whether these problems are decidable for
                   System F. This report proves that type checking in F
                   is undecidable, by a reduction from semi-unification,
                   and that typability in F is undecidable, by a
                   reduction from type checking. Because there is an
                   easy reduction from typability to type checking, the
                   two problems are equivalent. The reduction from type
                   checking to typability uses a novel method of
                   constructing lambda terms that simulate arbitrarily
                   chosen type environments. All of the results also
                   hold for the λI-calculus. {\copyright} 1999

                   type checking, which checks that a program satisfies
                   a known type, and type synthesis, which determines a
                   type from the program. Using checking enables
                   bidirectional typing to support features for which
                   inference is undecidable; using synthesis enables
                   bidirectional typing to avoid the large annotation
                   burden of explicitly typed languages. In addition,
                   bidirectional typing improves error locality. We

                   remains decidable even for very expressive type
                   systems), its error reporting, and its relative ease
                   of implementation. Following design principles from
                   proof theory, bidirectional typing can be applied to
                   many type constructs. The principles underlying a
                   bidirectional approach to polymorphism, however, are
                   less obvious. We give a declarative, bidirectional
                   account of higher-rank polymorphism, grounded in
                   proof theory; this calculus enjoys many properties
                   such as eta-reduction and predictability of

                   without any code change. Second, an existing
                   mechanized library on 𝜔-cocontinuous functors had
                   to be extended by constructions and theorems
                   necessary for constructing multi-sorted syntax.
                   Third, the theoretical framework for the semantical
                   signatures had to be generalized from a monoidal to a
                   bicategorical setting, again to account for
                   non-endofunctors arising in the typed case. This uses
                   actions of endofunctors on functors with given
                   source, and the corresponding notion of strong
                   functors between actions, all formalized in UniMath
                   using a recently developed library of bicategory
                   theory. We explain what needed to be done to plug all
                   of these ingredients together, modularly. The main
                   result of our work is a general construction that,
                   when fed with a signature for a simply-typed
                   language, returns an implementation of that language
                   together with suitable boilerplate code, in
                   particular, a certified monadic substitution
                   operation.},

                   includes a notion of binder and corresponding bound
                   occurrences, along with the accompanying notions of
                   α-equivalence, capture-avoiding substitution, typing
                   contexts, runtime environments, and so on. In the
                   past, implementing and reasoning about programming
                   languages required careful handling to maintain the
                   correct behaviour of bound variables. Modern
                   programming languages include features that enable
                   constraints like scope safety to be expressed in
                   types. Nevertheless, the programmer is still forced
                   to write the same boilerplate over again for each new
                   implementation of a scope-safe operation (e.g.,
                   renaming, substitution, desugaring, printing), and
                   then again for correctness proofs. We present an
                   expressive universe of syntaxes with binding and
                   demonstrate how to (1) implement scope-safe

  abstract =      {We develop algebraic models of simple type theories,
                   laying out a framework that extends universal algebra
                   to incorporate both algebraic sorting and variable
                   binding. Examples of simple type theories include the
                   unityped and simply-typed λ-calculi, the
                   computational λ-calculus, and predicate logic.Simple
                   type theories are given models in presheaf
                   categories, with structure specified by algebras of
                   polynomial endofunctors that correspond to natural
                   deduction rules. Initial models, which we construct,
                   abstractly describe the syntax of simple type
                   theories. Taking substitution structure into
                   consideration, we further provide sound and complete
                   semantics in structured cartesian multicategories.
                   This development generalises Lambek's correspondence
                   between the simply-typed λ-calculus and
                   cartesian-closed categories, to arbitrary simple type

  abstract =      {The correct definition and implementation of
                   non-trivial type systems is difficult and requires
                   expert knowledge, which is not available to
                   developers of domain-specific languages (DSLs) in
                   practice. We propose Veritas, a workbench that
                   simplifies the development of sound type systems.
                   Veritas provides a single, high-level specification
                   language for type systems, from which it
                   automatically tries to derive soundness proofs and
                   efficient and correct type-checking algorithms. For
                   verification, Veritas combines off-the-shelf
                   automated first-order theorem provers with automated
                   proof strategies specific to type systems. For
                   deriving efficient type checkers, Veritas provides a
                   collection of optimization strategies whose
                   applicability to a given type system is checked
                   through verification on a case-by-case basis. We have
                   developed a prototypical implementation of Veritas
                   and used it to verify type soundness of the
                   simply-typed lambda calculus and of parts of typed
                   SQL. Our experience suggests that many of the
                   individual verification steps can be automated and,
                   in particular, that a high degree of automation is
                   possible for type systems of DSLs.},

                   objects in categories of categories with families
                   (cwfs) with extra structure. To this end, we
                   simultaneously define the notion of a presentation Σ
                   of a generalized algebraic theory and the associated
                   category CwF Σ of small cwfs with a Σ-structure and
                   cwf-morphisms that preserve Σ-structure on the nose.
                   Our definition refers to the purely semantic notion
                   of uniform family of contexts, types, and terms in
                   CwF Σ . Furthermore, we show how to syntactically
                   construct an initial cwf with a Σ-structure. This
                   result can be viewed as a generalization of
                   Birkhoff's completeness theorem for equational logic.
                   It is obtained by extending Castellan, Clairambault,
                   and Dybjer's construction of an initial cwf. We
                   provide examples of generalized algebraic theories

                   and categories with families with extra structure for
                   some type formers of Martin-L{\"o}f type theory. The
                   models of these are internal monoids, internal
                   categories, and internal categories with families
                   (with extra structure) in a small category with
                   families. Finally, we show how to extend our
                   definition to some generalized algebraic theories
                   that are not finitely presented, such as the theory
                   of contextual cwfs.},
