\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Type checking as a transition from (parsed) abstract syntax trees to well-typed terms.
  \item Bidirectional typing is the only solution that works that scales well.
  \item Not yet a general theory but by now a design principle.
    No `type checker generator' as each type checker is still designed and implemented on a case-by-case basis, but can be derived from a syntax-directed type theory `easily'.
  \item The existing work of bidirectional typing does not take account of missing annotations carefully enough. 
  \item A meta-problem: existing work is based on (or at least left unspecified) classical logic.
    One has to state soundness of completeness of their type checking algorithm in a less straightforward way.
  \item A review of what has been done towards this line of research.
  \item Finally, our responses (contributions of this paper).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Plan and Contributions of this paper}

Our assumptions and contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Assumption: Syntax-directed typing rules
  \item Practical: bidirectionalisation over annotatability, decidability over soundness and completeness.
  \item Generic: Type checking once and for all bidirectional type systems for simple types.
  \item Correct and Constructive: Fully formalised in Martin-LÃ¶f type theory (with Axiom K).
    LEM is not assumed, so a decidable statement has both computational and non-trivial logical readings.
\end{enumerate}

Plan of this paper:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Key ideas (\Cref{sec:key-ideas})
  \item Definitions for simple type theories and for bidirectional type systems (signature erasure and mode annotation) (\Cref{sec:defs})
  \item Soundness, completeness, bidirectionalisation, and annotatability (\Cref{sec:annotatability})
    \Josh{Erasure from bidirectional typing derivation to raw terms with a mode}
  \item Bidirectional type inference (\Cref{sec:type-synthesis})
  \item Formalisation with further examples (\Cref{sec:formalisation})
  \item Future work (\Cref{sec:future})
\end{enumerate}
