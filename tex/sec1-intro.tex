\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

%  Bidirectional typing had only been a set of principles and characteristics to design typing rules so that a type synthesis algorithm can be `read off' easily
  %, subsuming soundness, completeness, and decidability of type synthesis algorithm.
%  Our work addresses the problem with existing methodologies, setting the stage for further advances towards a more general theory of type synthesis.

  %In short, this paper is a small but first step towards a general theory of type checking and inference.
  %By formalizing our theory of bidirectional type synthesise in \Agda, we provide a framework capable of handling bidirectional type systems of simple types uniformly.
  %Our work addresses the problem with existing methodologies, setting the stage for further advances towards a more general theory of type synthesis.
Points to elaborate:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Type inference and checking as a transition from (parsed) abstract syntax trees to well-typed terms.
  \item Bidirectional typing is by now the only solution that scales well.
  \item Not yet a general theory but by now a design principle.
    No `type checker generator' as each type checker is implemented on a case-by-case basis, but an algorithm can usually be read off from syntax-directed typing rules.
    A hint to a general pattern in syntax-directedness.
  \item The existing work of bidirectional typing does not take account of practical aspects such as missing annotation.
    Lightly or rarely discussed.
  \item A meta-problem: existing work is based on classical logic (or left unspecified at least).
    Soundness of completeness of a type checking algorithm in a less straightforward way.
  \item A review of what has been done towards this line of research.
  \item Finally, our responses (contributions of this paper).
\end{enumerate}


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use application in spin form to justify our design choice: type expression of arbitrary rank and the number of constructs in a calculus.
  \item Argue that syntax-directed form is essential and practical.
  \item Pfenning's recipe is only of design guide not a technical requirement (there are many exceptions).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Plan and Contributions of this paper}

Our assumptions and contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Assumption: Syntax-directed typing rules
  \item Practical: bidirectionalisation over annotatability, decidability over soundness and completeness.
  \item Generic: Type checking once and for all bidirectional type systems for simple types.
  \item Correct and Constructive: Fully formalised in Martin-LÃ¶f type theory (with Axiom K).
    LEM is not assumed, so a decidable statement has both computational and non-trivial logical readings.
\end{enumerate}

Plan of this paper:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Key ideas (\Cref{sec:key-ideas})
  \item Definitions for bidirectional type systems (bidirectional binding signature, bidirectional type systems, signature erasure and mode annotation) (\Cref{sec:defs})
  \item Soundness, completeness, bidirectionalisation, and annotatability (\Cref{sec:annotatability})
    \Josh{Erasure from bidirectional typing derivation to raw terms with a mode}
  \item Bidirectional type inference (\Cref{sec:type-synthesis})
  \item Formalisation and further examples (\Cref{sec:formalisation})
  \item Concluding remarks (\Cref{sec:future})
