\LT{how to type Agda code without lhs2tex?}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item (Bidirectional) binding signature, functor, and terms (extrinsic typing, raw terms, raw terms in some mode) --- 2.5 pp
  \item Compare the induction principle and the \Agda proof of Soundness --- 2 pp
  \item type synthesis and checking -- 0.5 p
  \item Examples including STLC (PCF), application in spine form --- 1p
\end{enumerate}

\LT{First, it is noteworthy that the set of term constructs in a type theory need not be finite.
For instance, a type theory may adopt a spine application which takes indefinitely many arguments---for each number $n$ of arguments an $(n+1)$-ary application construct can be introduced, so even if each operation has a definite number of arguments by definition a spine application is still expressible.}
