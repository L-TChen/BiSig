\paragraph{Beyond simple types}
While algebraic approaches to polymorphic types have been developed~\citep{Fiore2013,Hamana2011}, these approaches do not take subtyping into account.
Subtyping is essential for formulating important concepts such as \emph{principal types} in type synthesis.
On the other hand, in the realm of dependent types, \citeauthor{Cartmell1986}'s generalized algebraic theories~\citeyearpar{Cartmell1986} can handle a wide variety of dependent type theories.
\citet{Bezem2021} investigate the notion of presentation (extending the notion of signature) in the context of generalized algebraic theories.
Nonetheless, type synthesis for dependent types requires normalisation or some form of conversion to check type equality.
Normalisation in its generic form still remains out of reach and recent advances in this topic are discussed in the doctoral thesis by~\citet{Valliappan2023}.
